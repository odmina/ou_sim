class OU_process_2v(object):
    """
    This class defines two variable, stationary Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process
    and allows data simulation.

    Follows symbols from Gardiner (2009).

    The process can be initialized with A and sigma or A and BB_T
    (for a given A and sigma, BB_T is known and vice versa).
    Initialization with all three parameters will fail.

    Args:

        `A`: centralizing matrix `A` links the variables in
        the process. It is asserted to be a real matrix with
        positive eigenvalues. Voelkle et al. also call it A, but in the exponent in the
        process equation it comes without a minus (and for that
        parametrization eigenvalues have to be negative).
        It is called B by Oravecz et al.

        `sigma`: covariance matrix of the stationary OU process.
        Called sigma by Gardiner (2009). It is a dot product of
        process state at time t, X(t), and its transpose
        (for a process with 0 mean or centered process). It has to be
        a symmetric, positive-semidefinite matrix.

        `BB_T`: error covariance matrix of the process, used in the
        stochastic term of the process equation, also called diffusion
        matrix. Cholesky decomposition of this matrix (B)
        appears in the stochastic term of the equation of X(t). Thus,
        the matrix has to be Hermitian, positive-definite matrix
        (since for the simulation only real valued matrices are used,
        BB_T has to be symmetric and positive-definite and this is the
        condition that is asserted).
        For the simulation, the conditional distribution of X(t)
        given X(t-d) is reparametrized so that it depends on B and sigma.
        Thus, the following condition has to be satisfied:
        BB_T = B*sigma + sigma*B.T is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix.

    During data simulation parameter `mu` may be provided.
        It is the mean of the process, it is 0 by default.

    The simulation uses discrete timesteps of equal length `d`
        and at each timestep samples X(t) from a conditional
        distribution of X(t) given X(t-d). The distribution is
        normal with parameters calculated using eq (9) from
        Oravecz et al. 2011.

    Simulation runs for `total_time` units
        with 1/'d' samples per unit.

    Initial value of the process X(0) is sampled from bivariate normal
        distribution with mean `mu` and covariance matrix `sigma`.
